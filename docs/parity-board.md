# Feature parity board

What Renderly does today, what's open for contribution, and what's deferred on purpose.
This is the board PLAN.md §4 calls for — pick work from here.

**Legend:** ✅ shipped · 🟡 works, wants a better implementation · ⬜ open · ⏸️ deferred

Open an issue saying what you're picking up before starting large work, and read
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) plus [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) §0 first. The
highest-leverage contributions are the 🟡 rows: the command, the GUI surface, and the tests
already exist, so the work is swapping the algorithm underneath a stable API.

## Editing core

| Feature | State | Entry points |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-track timeline (video/audio/caption) | ✅ | Array order = compositing z-order |
| Trim / split / move / ripple, snapping, groups, razor | ✅ | `timeline/interactions.ts`, command API |
| Track reordering | ✅ | `MoveTrack`; drag the track header grip |
| Keyframe animation + easing curves | ✅ | `project/anim.rs`; transform, opacity, volume |
| Speed ramp with pitch-corrected audio | ✅ | `SetClipSpeed` |
| Undo/redo | ✅ | Shared with agent edits over the bridge |
| Nested sequences / compound clips | ⬜ | Schema change — discuss in an issue first |
| Adjustment layers | ⬜ | Effects applied to everything below a track |

## Rendering & effects

| ID | Feature | State | Entry points / notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| — | WGSL effect system (color, blur, glitch, LUT…) | ✅ | Same code in preview and export |
| — | Transitions (10 built-in) | ✅ | `SetClipTransition` |
| P4-1a | Shape masks (rect/ellipse) + compositor alpha path | ✅ | schema v6; `SetClipMask`; `renderly-core/src/mask.rs` |
| P4-3b | Shape mask authoring UI | ✅ | Mask tool (M); `PreviewMaskOverlay`; inspector feather/invert |
| — | Raster / generated mattes in preview | 🟡 | Export only — needs fs-free decode on wasm32 |
| — | Pack `.cube` LUTs in preview | 🟡 | Export only — needs the LUT packed without a filesystem load |
| P4-3 | Chroma key | 🟡 | `builtin:chroma_key`; CPU per-pixel, wants a WGSL pass |
| P4-1b | Background removal | 🟡 | `SetClipBackgroundRemoval`, `GenerateBackgroundMatte`; heuristic + optional `RENDERLY_SEG_CLI` |
| P4-ML | Core-hosted ONNX RVM/BiRefNet | ⬜ | **The headline open item.** See the recorded decision below |
| — | Captions burned in | ✅ | Preview and export share the `ab_glyph` rasterizer |
| — | Captions in the Canvas2D fallback | ⏸️ | WebGPU covers evergreen browsers; low value |
| — | Hardware decode (`-hwaccel`) / encode (NVENC/QSV) | ✅ | Probed, software fallback |
| — | Linked FFmpeg (`ffmpeg-the-third`) | ⏸️ | Waiting on vcpkg/`FFMPEG_DIR` across all environments |

## AI & automation

| ID | Feature | State | Entry points / notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| — | MCP server (full command API) | ✅ | `renderly-mcp` |
| — | Perception: scenes, silence, peaks, transcript, frame render | ✅ | |
| — | Live bridge to the running app (shared undo) | ✅ | [bridge-protocol.md](bridge-protocol.md) |
| — | Whisper auto-captions | ✅ | Local; `RENDERLY_WHISPER_MODEL` |
| — | TTS voiceover (local Piper / BYO cloud key) | ✅ | `GenerateVoiceover` |
| — | Ducking, fades, mixing | ✅ | |
| P4-2 | Audio denoise | 🟡 | `SetClipAudioDenoise` (`afftdn`); wants an RNNoise-class model |
| P4-4 | Motion tracking | 🟡 | `TrackMotion`; centroid heuristic, wants feature tracking |
| P4-5 | Stabilization | 🟡 | `StabilizeClip`; centroid-smoothed keyframes |
| P4-4b | Auto-reframe | 🟡 | `AutoReframeClip`; wants subject detection |
| P4-6b | Text-to-sticker | 🟡 | `GenerateSticker`; locally generated PNG, not an image model |
| P4-6 | Templates | ✅ | Pack `templates[]` + `ApplyTemplate` |
| P4-7 | Multicam groups + angle switch | ✅ | `CreateMulticamGroup`, `SetMulticamAngle` |

## Platform & distribution

| Feature | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | ✅ | Primary target, dogfooded daily |
| macOS / Linux — builds | ✅ | Green in CI on every push |
| macOS / Linux — runtime QA | ⬜ | **Wanted:** run it, report what breaks |
| Installer / packaged release | 🟡 | `tauri build` produces one; release flow being set up |
| Linux preview on WebKitGTK | ⬜ | WebGPU lags there; may need a Chromium-based webview — see [preview-webview.md](preview-webview.md) risks. (The native per-OS preview, including the Wayland subsurface path, was removed in that migration's P4.) |
| OTIO interop | ⬜ | PLAN.md §2; nobody has needed it yet |

## Testing & infrastructure

| Area | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `renderly-core` tests | ✅ | 107 |
| `renderly-app` (Rust) tests | ✅ | 16 |
| `renderly-mcp` tests | 🟡 | 8 — thin for an agent-facing surface |
| `renderly-cli` tests | ⬜ | **Zero.** Good first issue |
| Frontend tests | ⬜ | Verification currently runs through the browser harness |
| Export pixel-parity suite | ⬜ | Golden-frame comparisons, preview vs export |

## Good first issues

- `renderly-cli` integration tests — small surface, stable command API.
- macOS or Linux runtime QA: install, run, file what breaks.
- An asset pack — caption styles, LUTs, SFX, transitions
  ([`examples/packs/starter`](../examples/packs/starter) is the template).
- A WASM plugin effect ([`examples/plugins/invert`](../examples/plugins/invert), ~30 lines).
- Chroma key as a WGSL pass — self-contained port of existing CPU code, sitting next to
  effects that already work that way.

## Recorded decision — inference runtime

WASM frame plugins instantiate per call and copy full RGBA, which is unsuitable for
RVM/BiRefNet. Phase 4.1 therefore ships **heuristic mattes** plus an optional
**`RENDERLY_SEG_CLI`** escape hatch (same shape as the Whisper integration). Linking `ort`
/ ONNX into core remains a follow-up pending AGPL-compatible license review — and never as
a user-loadable native DLL plugin.

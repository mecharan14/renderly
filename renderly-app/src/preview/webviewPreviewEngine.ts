// - "webgpu" (P2): browser-decoded <video>/<img> elements are handed to renderly-core's
//   actual compositor compiled to wasm32 (renderly-wasm's WasmCompositor) — effects,
//   transitions, masks, chroma, and keyframed animation render with the SAME Rust/WGSL
//   code paths as native export (docs/preview-webview.md "Non-negotiables" #1). Frames
//   travel element → GPU texture via copyExternalImageToTexture (zero CPU readback).
// - "canvas2d" (P1 fallback): a Canvas2D mirror of core's timeline evaluation and
//   cover-fit + transform math. No effects/masks/LUTs/captions — kept as the graceful-
//   degradation path when WebGPU or the wasm module is unavailable.
//
// The element pool, dual-mode clock (backend playback:tick slew / standalone rAF),
// pre-seek, and seek-correction logic below are shared by both modes.
